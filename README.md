# benchmarking-embedding-models

I'm working on a restaurant similarity search engine and leveraging semantic search to deliver more accurate results. I was curious to see how different embedding models would perform on this task.
You can find the notebook with the code and the results [here](./embeddings_tests.ipynb)

I've also written a [blog post](https://tlbvr.com/blog/benchmarking-embedding-models-semantic-search/) about this project.
